# Redis Caching Example

This Python script demonstrates a basic caching mechanism using Redis, a popular in-memory data structure store. The script defines a function to fetch data from a source, and a caching function that utilizes Redis to store and retrieve data efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system.
- The `redis` Python library. You can install it using:

  ```bash
  pip install redis
* A running Redis server with the appropriate connection details.
Configuration
Replace the placeholder values in the script with your Redis server information:
    ```bash
    # Replace these values with your Redis server information
    redis_host = 'your_redis_host'
    redis_port = your_redis_port
    redis_password = 'your_redis_password'
# Script Overview
### 1- Connection to Redis:

The script establishes a connection to the Redis server using the provided host, port, and password.


### 2- Data Fetching from Source:

The fetch_data_from_source function is a placeholder for fetching data from the actual source (e.g., a database). Replace it with your specific data fetching logic.

### 3- Caching Logic:

The get_data_with_caching function attempts to retrieve data from the Redis cache.
If the data is found in the cache, it is returned.
If not, the data is fetched from the source, stored in the cache with an expiration time (60 seconds in this example), and then returned.

### 4- Testing the Caching Function:

The script tests the caching function with a sample data key (example_key).
The final cached data is printed.

### 5- Closing the Redis Connection:

Optionally, the script closes the Redis connection.

# Running the Script
Execute the script using:
   ```bash
python redis_chaching.py
